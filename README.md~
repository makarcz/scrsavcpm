The CP/M operating system, popular in 1970-s, standardized computing for
business and was a precursor to MS-DOS.
I like to play with retro computers, Commodore 128 being my favorite 8-bit
system. It can run CP/M and since text based user interface is still my
favorite, I enjoy working with this system.
One application lacking on the system was a screen saver to display random
content on the screen to prevent CRT burnout.
I also wanted to have an optional screen lock function, where user would
provide a passphrase to unlock the screen.
Some applications are equipped with their own screen blanking function, e.g.:
VDE editor with control key combination can blank the screen until restored
with a key press.
However I wanted something like that to be available from the system prompt,
as a standalone application.
Enter SCRSAV project, written in Aztec C version 1.05.

Enjoy!
